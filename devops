### How to make environment variables available to cron jobs

> 0 5 * * * . /home/darko/project/.vars.env; /home/darko/project/command_to_run.py

The . is quivalent the source command. Anytime this cron is run, it will set all environment variables defined inside .vars.env before executing the command.
It's good practice to keep this hidden and also to add it to your gitignore. Also good practice to keep the same name (.vars.env) across all your projects.
